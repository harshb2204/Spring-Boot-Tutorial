# Redis Caching in Spring Boot

Using Redis for caching in Spring Boot offers several advantages over the default caching mechanisms, such as ConcurrentHashMap-based caching or SimpleCacheManager. Here's why Redis is a better choice:

## 1. Distributed Caching
- The default caching in Spring Boot (like ConcurrentHashMap) is in-memory and local to the application instance.
- Redis, being an in-memory database, allows caching at a centralized location, making it ideal for distributed applications (e.g., microservices).

## 2. Persistence
- Default caching is volatileâ€”it gets wiped out when the application restarts.
- Redis supports persistence via RDB snapshots and AOF (Append-Only File) logging, ensuring that cached data is not lost on restarts.

## 3. Scalability
- Redis can scale horizontally with clustering and vertically with replication, whereas default caching is limited by heap size.
- Large datasets in default caching can cause OutOfMemoryErrors, while Redis efficiently handles larger caches.
