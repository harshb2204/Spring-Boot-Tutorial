# Microservices

- Microservices are an architectural style where applications are
developed as a collection of small, loosely coupled, independently
deployable services.

## Characteristics of Microservices
- Small, focused on doing one thing well
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Decentralized data management
- Communication via lightweight protocols (typically HTTP/REST)

## Comparison with Monolith
- Monolith: tightly coupled, single codebase
- Microservices: loosely coupled, multiple independent services

## Challenges of Microservices
- Increased complexity in managing multiple services
- Distributed System Issues like Latency, load balancing, network reliability, and consistency
- Managing transactions and consistency across services
- Handling communication protocols (REST, gRPC, messaging)
- Monitoring and Logging needs centralized monitoring and logging solutions
