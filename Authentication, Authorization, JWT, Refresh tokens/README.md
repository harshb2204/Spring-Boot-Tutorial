# Authentication and Authorization

## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is. It's like checking an ID card to confirm a person's identity.

### Common Authentication Methods:
1. Username/Password
2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
3. Biometric Authentication
4. Single Sign-On (SSO)
5. Token-based Authentication (like JWT)

## Authorization
Authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. It happens after authentication and determines what an authenticated user can do.

### Authorization Concepts:
1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
2. Access Control Lists (ACL)
3. Permission Levels
4. Scope-based Authorization

## Key Differences

| Authentication | Authorization |
|----------------|---------------|
| Verifies who the user is | Determines what resources a user can access |
| Happens first | Happens after authentication |
| Usually requires user input | Usually invisible to the user |
| Can be partially changed by the user (e.g., password) | Can only be changed by an administrator |

## Best Practices
1. Always implement both authentication and authorization
2. Use secure protocols (HTTPS)
3. Implement the principle of least privilege
4. Regular security audits
5. Proper session management
6. Secure password storage (hashing)
7. Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

## Common Implementation Tools
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- OAuth 2.0
- OpenID Connect
- Passport.js (for Node.js)
- Spring Security (for Java)
- Django Authentication (for Python)

## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
JSON Web Tokens are an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. They are commonly used for authentication and information exchange.

### Advantages of JWT
1. **Stateless Authentication**: No need to store session information on the server
2. **Cross-domain/CORS**: Can be used across different domains
3. **Performance**: Reduces database lookups as token contains user information
4. **Decentralized**: Can be validated without accessing a central server
5. **Mobile-friendly**: Works well with native mobile apps
6. **Flexibility**: Can include custom claims and metadata

### Disadvantages of JWT
1. **Token Size**: JWTs are larger than session tokens, increasing bandwidth usage
2. **Can't Revoke Individual Tokens**: Once issued, tokens remain valid until expiration
3. **Token Storage**: Must be stored securely on client-side to prevent XSS attacks
4. **Secret Key Management**: Server's secret key must be well-protected
5. **Token Expiration**: Balance needed between security (shorter expiry) and user experience (longer expiry)
6. **Payload Size**: Limited by URL length in GET requests if used in query parameters

### Security Considerations
1. Never store sensitive information in JWT payload (it's base64 encoded, not encrypted)
2. Use HTTPS to prevent token interception
3. Implement proper token expiration
4. Consider using refresh tokens for long-term authentication
5. Validate all tokens on the server side
6. Use strong secret keys for signing
